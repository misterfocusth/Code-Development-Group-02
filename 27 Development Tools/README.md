# Development Tools

## What is a Development Tool?
A tool that supports the rapid implementation of software applications upon a programming platform. The term either refers to tools that enable development of full-fledged applications using compiled / interpreted code or software packages used by developers to author and package multimedia content deliverable to end users. The former is commonly referred to as ‘integrated development environment’ (IDE) and the latter as ‘authoring tool’.
